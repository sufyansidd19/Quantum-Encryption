# Quantum vs Classical Encryption 🔐

A Python Flask-based web app that enables secure file encryption and decryption using AES (classical) and quantum encryption techniques.  
It compares both methods in terms of **speed**, **efficiency**, and **security**, demonstrating how quantum approaches can enhance modern cryptographic systems.

## 🧠 How It Works
1. Upload a file (e.g., PDF, text, or image).  
2. Choose encryption mode: **Classical AES**, **Randomized AES**, or **Quantum**.  
3. Compare metrics such as encryption time and efficiency.  
4. Download the output file securely.
